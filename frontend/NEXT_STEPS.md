## Next steps for developers

1. Integrate Playwright tests into CI (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI) with browser dependency caching to reduce runtime.
2. Add per-spec shared mock helpers (fixtures for `page.route`) to minimize duplication and simplify maintenance.
3. Add smoke coverage for mobile viewport variants in navigation and schedule flows.
4. Enable Playwright HTML report publishing as CI artifact for easier debugging.
